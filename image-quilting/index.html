            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This project aims to implement the image quilting algorithm for texture synthesis and transfer 
                based on the 2001 SIGGRAPH paper by Efros and Freeman. Texture synthesis is the creation of a larger 
                texture from a small sample, and texture transfer is giving an object the appearance of a sample while 
                preserving its shape. In texture synthesis you sample patches and lay them in overlapping patterns while 
                computing a path along pixels with similar intensities in the overlapping region and select which region 
                to draw from. Texture transfer on the other hand is done by encouraging sampled patches to have similar 
                appearance to a target image and match the overlapping regions of already sampled patches.

            <h2>Randomly Sampled Texture</h2>
            <p>
                The <code>quilt_random</code> function generates a new texture by filling 
                an output image of size <code>out_size</code> with randomly sampled square 
                patches of size <code>patch_size</code> taken from an input texture <code>sample</code>. 
                The function iterates over the output image grid, selecting random top-left coordinates 
                from the input texture to extract patches without exceeding its boundaries. These 
                patches are then placed sequentially into the corresponding grid locations in the 
                output image. The result is a randomized, quilted texture that mimics the input 
                texture's appearance but without blending or smoothing between patches. The result of this 
                process looks like the following:

        <section id="Overlapping Patches">
            <h2>Overlapping Patches</h2>
            <p>
                The <code>quilt_simple</code> function creates a texture by sampling square patches 
                from an input texture and arranging them to fill an output image of size <code>out_size</code>. 
                Starting with a random patch in the upper-left corner, subsequent patches are sampled to 
                overlap with existing ones, ensuring alignment in horizontal, vertical, or both directions, 
                depending on their position in the grid. The overlap between patches is evaluated using a 
                helper function, <code>ssd_patch</code>, which computes the cost of sampling a patch based 
                on the sum of squared differences (SSD) between the overlapping regions of the sampled and 
                existing patches. This computation uses a masked template for efficiency, leveraging filtering 
                operations to calculate the SSD for all channels of the input texture. Another helper 
                function, <code>choose_sample</code>, selects a patch with a low cost from the cost image, 
                where the selection threshold is determined by a tolerance parameter <code>tol</code>. A 
                lower <code>tol</code> results in deterministic copying of the input texture, while a higher 
                <code>tol</code> introduces more randomness for diverse textures. Once a patch is selected, 
                its pixels are copied into the corresponding position in the output image. As the results below 
                show, this process produces slightly improved quilts.

            <h2>Seam Finding</h2>
            <p>
                As is evident in the previous examples, there are still very visible seams between the patches. 
                The next step is to incorporate seam finding to remove these edge artifacts according to 
                section 2.1 of the paper. This process works by finding the min-cost contiguous path from left to 
                right in a patch according to the square difference of the output and new patch. This addition 
                further improves the quilt with less defined edges.

            <h2>Seam Finding</h2>
            <p>
                The <code>texture_transfer</code> function generates an output texture guided 
                by a target image (<code>guidance_im</code>) by modifying the <code>quilt_cut</code> 
                approach to incorporate a target-driven cost term. It begins by placing a 
                random patch from the sample image in the upper-left corner of the output. 
                For each subsequent patch, it calculates two cost components: the overlap cost, 
                which ensures smooth transitions between adjacent patches using the sum of 
                squared differences (SSD) between overlapping regions, and the target cost, 
                which matches the sampled patch to the corresponding region in the target image. 
                These costs are combined with a weighting factor, <code>alpha</code>, to balance 
                texture similarity and adherence to the target image. A low-cost patch is then 
                selected and copied into the output image. Seams between patches are optimized 
                using seam-cutting techniques to ensure smooth boundaries. The function iterates 
                over the grid of patches, progressively filling the output while minimizing 
                discontinuities and aligning the texture with the target's structure. This process 
                results in a synthesized texture that blends the input sample's characteristics 
                with the appearance of the target image.
