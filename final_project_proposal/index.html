		<h2>Summary</h2>
		This project will explore several different methods of terrain generation. In addition to the base methods of terrain generation, Neural Style Transfer 
		will be utilized apply the overall style of real world terrains to our generated ones. The combination of these methods will in theory produce a more 
		natural looking terrain map for terrain generation. 

		<h2>Problem Description</h2>
		Terrain generation is a concept that is widely used, especially across the gaming industry to generate the worlds you play in. You could create an 
		extremely realistic world by manually sculpting every terrain feature in the world, however as game worlds are expanding, this is becoming less and 
		less feasible. To speed this process up developers have turned to procedural generation to automatically create vast worlds. However this presents 
		its own set of challenges. Terrain generation algorithms often utilize noise to determine height maps of a terrain, but this often leads to unnatural 
		looking peaks and valleys as pure randomness does not encompass the variations in the natural world. There are many ways to solve this problem, including 
		erosion based algorithms, cellular automata, and various smoother noise generators like perlin and simplex. While many of these methods can work quite 
		well they can also be quite computationally intensive. The goal of combining these methods with something like style transfer is to deliver something 
		that is both realistic and computationally feasible for a game setting. 
		<br><br>

		<h2>Goals and Deliverables</h2>
		<h3>Planned Deliverables</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Generate a heightmap from perlin noise.</li>
			<li>Apply various style transfers to enhance the result of the original terrain
			</li>
			<li>Visualize final terrain map, should look something like the following image</li>
		</ul>

		The success of the final result will require a qualitative discussion of the tradeoffs between perceived realism of 
		the procedural terrains, with the time it took to achieve each result. The end goal is to have a realistic world that 
		is not prohibitively computationally expensive. There is no set balance between these two goals, however we will certainly 
		time and compare each method. 

		<h3>Aspirational Goals</h3>
		There are many ways to create noise maps like gaussian, perlin and simplex noise. Each of these methods achieves a different outcome 
		and sometimes different methods can be combineed together to create different levels of detail at different granularities. 

		<h2>Schedule</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Week 1:</b> Terrain generation with perlin noise algorithm and basic visualizations with pyvista</li>
			<li><b>Week 2:</b> Apply style transfer with various real world height maps</li>
			<li><b>Week 3:</b> Explore alternate noise generation algorithms</li>
			<li><b>Week 4:</b> Benchmark and complete visualizations/demo</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Resources</h2>
		<a href="https://web3.arxiv.org/abs/2403.08782">Procedural terrain generation with style transfer</a> <br><br>
		The main inspiration and reference for our project is the above paper “Procedural terrain generation with style 
		transfer” by Fabio Merrizi. 
		<br><br>
		For physical resources we will plan to use a physical Nvidia 1080Ti GPU if necessary for the style transfer component. 
		We may also leverage cloud computing resources through Google Colab. 
		<br><br>
		We will plan to use Python for the code logic, and use numpy, tensorflow, and scipy. For 3D terrain visualization in 
		Python, pyvista for the 3D plotting and rioxarray for handling geospatial raster data will probably be useful, along 
		with numpy again for computing and working with data.
